I'm pleased to hold a mentorship program focused on Machine Learning and Reinforcement Learning. This initiative is open to students, professionals considering a career transition, or anyone with a keen interest in these areas. While I do not claim to be the ultimate authority in these areas, I believe in the power of collective learning and the insights that can be gained through mutual exploration.

Our discussions will center around life, research related stuff, career plan, and whatnot. Regular meetings will be scheduled to monitor progress and address emerging challenges.

I encourage individuals from underrepresented groups in tech to participate. Please note, this is a non-paid program, driven by the joy of knowledge sharing and mutual learning.

Interested? Please send an email with `Mentorship Program` in the subject line, briefly outlining your interests, goals, and what you hope to gain from this mentorship. I look forward to potentially embarking on this journey together.
