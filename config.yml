          title: Professor Dr von Igelfeld
          subtitle: "I'm a PhD student at **McGill University**, advised by [Prof. Hsiu-Chin Lin](https://sites.google.com/site/hsiuchinlin/home?authuser=0), focusing on safe robot learning. Before McGill, I worked as a research engineer at [Ivy](https://lets-unify.ai/), where we developed tools to integrate popular ML frameworks like TensorFlow, PyTorch, JAX, and NumPy, enabling complex computational graphs to run seamlessly on various devices. Earlier, I spent a year as a visiting researcher at the [AdaComp Lab](https://adacomp.comp.nus.edu.sg/) at the National University of Singapore, collaborating with [Prof. Panpan Cai](https://cindycia.github.io/) and [Prof. David Hsu](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~dyhsu/) on robust planning for self-driving vehicles under uncertainty. I also hold a master's degree from Oregon State University, where I worked with [Prof. Alan Fern](https://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~afern/) on explainable and robust RL.

          My research primarily focuses on robot learning, from improving safety to generalization. Currently, I am exploring how RL and world models can be effectively applied in robotics.

          I am open to collaborations. Feel free to reach out via email for projects or research opportunities. You can also visit my [get in touch](https://modanesh.github.io/get_in_touch/) page.
